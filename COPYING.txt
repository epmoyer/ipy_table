Our Copyright Policy
--------------------

ipy_table uses a shared copyright model. Each contributor maintains copyright
over their contributions to ipy_table. But, it is important to note that these
contributions are typically only changes to the repositories. Thus, the ipy_table
source code, in its entirety is not the copyright of any single person or
institution.  Instead, it is the collective copyright of the entire ipy_table
Development Team.  If individual contributors want to maintain a record of what
changes/contributions they have specific copyright on, they should indicate
their copyright in the commit message of the change, when they commit the
change to one of the ipy_table repositories.

With this in mind, the following banner should be used in any source code file
to indicate the copyright and license terms:
